# Investigate-a-Relational-Database-with-SQL
This project was created in August 2021 as part of the requirements to complete the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.

### Description
This project makes use of SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. The DVD rental database holds information and business processes about a company that rents movie DVDs. SQL codes were written to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database such as "What patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups?" and "How they compare on payment earnings and how the stores compare in their performance".
